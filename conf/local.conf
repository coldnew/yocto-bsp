#
# This is the default setting for coldnew's Yocto project
#
# For more setting, please see:

#

#
# Parallelism Options
#
# These two options control how much parallelism BitBake should use. The first
# option determines how many tasks bitbake should run in parallel:
#
BB_NUMBER_THREADS ?= "${@oe.utils.cpu_count()}"

#
# The second option controls how many processes make should run in parallel when
# running compile tasks:
#
# Default to setting automatically based on cpu count
PARALLEL_MAKE ?= "-j ${@oe.utils.cpu_count()}"

#
# For a quad-core machine, BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "4", PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4" would
# be appropriate for example.

#
# Where to place downloads
#
# During a first build the system will download many different source code tarballs
# from various upstream projects. This can take a while, particularly if your network
# connection is slow. These are all stored in DL_DIR. When wiping and rebuilding you
# can preserve this directory to speed up this part of subsequent builds. This directory
# is safe to share between multiple builds on the same machine too.
#
# The default is a downloads directory under TOPDIR which is the build directory.
#
DL_DIR ?= "${BSPDIR}/downloads"

#
# Where to place shared-state files
#
# BitBake has the capability to accelerate builds based on previously built output.
# This is done using "shared state" files which can be thought of as cache objects
# and this option determines where those files are placed.
#
# You can wipe out TMPDIR leaving this directory intact and the build would regenerate
# from these files if no changes were made to the configuration. If changes were made
# to the configuration, only shared state files where the state was still valid would
# be used (done using checksums).
#
# The default is a sstate-cache directory under TOPDIR.
#
SSTATE_DIR ?= "${BSPDIR}/sstate-cache"

#
# Where to place the build output
#
# This option specifies where the bulk of the building work should be done and
# where BitBake should place its temporary files and output. Keep in mind that
# this includes the extraction and compilation of many applications and the toolchain
# which can use Gigabytes of hard disk space.
#
# The default is a tmp directory under TOPDIR.
#
#TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"

#
# Where to place deploy files
#
# Points to the general area that the OpenEmbedded build system uses to
# place images, packages, SDKs, and other output files that are ready to
# be used outside of the build system. By default, this directory
# resides within the Build Directory as ${TMPDIR}/deploy
DEPLOY_DIR ?= "${BSPDIR}/deploy/"

#
# Buildhistory
#
# Build history is disabled by default. To enable it, add the
# following INHERIT statement and set the BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT variable
# to "1" at the end of your conf/local.conf file found in the Build
# Directory:
#
# NOTE:
# Enabling build history increases your build times slightly,
# particularly for images, and increases the amount of disk space used
# during the build.
#
INHERIT += "buildhistory"
BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = "1"
BUILDHISTORY_DIR = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/buildhistory"

# Package Management configuration
#
# This variable lists which packaging formats to enable. Multiple package backends
# can be enabled at once and the first item listed in the variable will be used
# to generate the root filesystems.
# Options are:
#  - 'package_deb' for debian style deb files
#  - 'package_ipk' for ipk files are used by opkg (a debian style embedded package manager)
#  - 'package_rpm' for rpm style packages
#  - 'package_tar' for tar.gz style package
#
# E.g.: PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm package_deb package_ipk"
PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_ipk"

# Uncomment this to delete work files as the build progresses rather than
# keeping them around, which saves a lot of disk space. However, if any
# problems arise it can be useful to have the work files to examine, which
# is why it is off by default.
INHERIT += "rm_work"

#
# Qemu configuration
#
# By default qemu will build with a builtin VNC server where graphical output can be
# seen. The two lines below enable the SDL backend too. This assumes there is a
# libsdl library available on your build system.
PACKAGECONFIG_pn-qemu-native = "sdl"
PACKAGECONFIG_pn-nativesdk-qemu = "sdl"
ASSUME_PROVIDED += "libsdl-native"

#
# EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES
#
# https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/ref-manual/ref-manual.html#var-EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES
#
# The list of additional features to include in an image. Typically,
# you configure this variable in your local.conf file, which is found in
# the Build Directory. Although you can use this variable from within a
# recipe, best practices dictate that you do not.
#
# "dbg-pkgs" - Adds -dbg packages for all installed packages
#              including symbol information for debugging and
#              profiling.
#
# "debug-tweaks" - Makes an image suitable for development.
#                  For example, ssh root access has a blank
#                  password.  You should remove this feature
#                  before you produce a production image.
#
# "dev-pkgs" - Adds -dev packages for all installed packages.
#              This is useful if you want to develop against
#              the libraries in the image.
#
# "read-only-rootfs" - Creates an image whose root
#                      filesystem is read-only. See the
#                      "Creating a Read-Only Root Filesystem"
#                      section in the Yocto Project
#                      Development Manual for more
#                      information
#
# "tools-debug" - Adds debugging tools such as gdb and
#                 strace.
#
# "tools-profile" - Adds profiling tools such as oprofile,
#                   exmap, lttng and valgrind (x86 only).
#
# "tools-sdk" - Adds development tools such as gcc, make,
#               pkgconfig and so forth.
#
# "tools-testapps" - Adds useful testing tools such as
#                    ts_print, aplay, arecord and so
#                    forth.
#
EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "debug-tweaks tools-debug tools-profile tools-sdk"


#
# Default policy config
#
# The distribution setting controls which policy settings are used as defaults.
# The default value is fine for general Yocto project use, at least initially.
# Ultimately when creating custom policy, people will likely end up subclassing
# these defaults.
#
DISTRO ?= "poky"

#
# SDK/ADT target architecture
#
# This variable specifies the architecture to build SDK/ADT items for and means
# you can build the SDK packages for architectures other than the machine you are
# running the build on (i.e. building i686 packages on an x86_64 host).
# Supported values are i686 and x86_64
SDKMACHINE ?= "x86_64"
